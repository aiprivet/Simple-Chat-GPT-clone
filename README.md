This project is a simple implementation of Chat GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) using Vue.js 3 and Vuetify. Chat GPT is a powerful language model that can generate human-like responses based on given prompts. To make it work, you will need a valid API key, which should be entered in settings or hardcode it into code.
